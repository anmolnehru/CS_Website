I am in love with this new song I've been listening to on repeat. This is one of the major annoyances my girlfriend and roomates have to put up with on a daily basis. Anyway I digress, the song is titled 'Nothing Really Matters' by Mr. Probz. Apart from the catchy tunes and drops in the remix version of it; I am slowly coming to realize and appreciate the deep meaning behind the title of the song.

Now I want to be careful here and not overstep my boundaries. But I was certainly a control freak in my past snapshots of life and placed overdue importance on the importance of things, over thinking about conversations or impact of a decision I was going to make.

I have over time, realized the value of being mellow and taking things as they come in string. Don't get me wrong, you still need to care for things and give it your best as if you were controlling
