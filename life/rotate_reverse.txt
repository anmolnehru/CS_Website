What if Earth rotated in reverse? What would be the ramifications of that?

Tracing back from beginning of life, nah beginnig of when Earth was forming. Would minerals have formed the same way? Would dinosaurs still be alive?  Would we have had a chance to evolve.What all systems would be different? Let's speculate on these one by one.

Let's start with the more contemporary thoughts since they appear to be the more logical thought experiments and hence I'm fairly pre-disposed to solving/reasoning about them within the realm of objective limits. It's wise to make clear here that this thought experiment isn't the case of Earth's rotation suddenly switching polarities, but rather the reverse rotation being from the point of singularity, in other words the beginning of time, although the former would be a rather exciting investigation in of itself, with one very likely outcome being a lot of loss of life or property. The most basic difference we would see is the Sun rising in approximately diametrically opposite fashion. Would that have any meaningful effect on mankind? Well for starters people of Islamic faith would offer their obeisances in a different direction. People in Hawaii would experience the first Sun...
